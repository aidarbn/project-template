# Project Template

This is a general Go project template. You can use it as a start for your projects.

Here you should describe your project description.

## Dependencies

As a database for the project we use [Postgres 13](https://www.postgresql.org/).

For monitoring and error tracking we use [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Development tools installation

### Golang

Golang is a main language for the project.

You can install it with instructions from official website: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### Migration

We use migration tool to update scheme of the database.
You can find instruction for installation
here: [https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)
.

### Mocking

For mocking we use [https://github.com/vektra/mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery).

You can download it with this command:

```sh
go install github.com/vektra/mockery/v2@latest
```


## Service configuration

For the correct service work, you need to use environment variables or the `.env` file.

In order to use the file, download the [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)
binary file. General command to run `.env` file:

```bash
godotenv -f .env [command]
```

## Environment Variables

## Installation

### Manual

You can build the service with the following terminal command:

```bash
go build ./cmd/...
```

Before running the service set up the environment variables and run the app:

```bash
app
```

### Docker installation

Installation could be done with `docker` and `docker compose` tools. Set up the environment variables or use `.env`
file.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Migrations

Migrations are run automatically on service startup. But you can run them manually
with [golang-migrate tool](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).

Database pattern: `postgresql://DB_USER:DB_PASS@DB_HOST:DB_PORT/DB_NAME?sslmode=disable`

```bash
# create migration
migrate create -ext sql -dir ./test-migrations [migration name]

# manual migrations
migrate -database [database url] -path ./test-migrations up

# migration with URL
migrate -database postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable -path ./test-migrations up
```

## Testing

Unit-tests are using mocks generated by [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery). Mocks generation commands are
embedded in-source using [go:generate](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source)
comments, so before running tests, you need to launch code generation.

Integration tests run only with docker. You have to wait first time to load needed images.

Unit test also run during build.

```bash
# Run code generation
go generate ./...

# Run only unit tests
go test ./... -short

# Run all tests
go test ./... 
```

## Documentation

[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is a graphical representation of swagger specifications. You can
access REST documentation with "[base_endpoint]/docs/".

You can check availability of the application with "[base_endpoint]/status" endpoint.

## Note

I suggest to move pkg package to a separate repository.
